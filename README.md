# 🧩 Rubik’s Cube Solver

A full-stack **Rubik’s Cube Solver** that lets users input a scrambled cube state and generates an optimized step-by-step solution.  
Built with a **Python Flask backend** for solving logic and a **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend** for user interaction.  
Deployed with **Render (backend)** and **GitHub Pages (frontend)**.
